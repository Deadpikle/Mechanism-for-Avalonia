# Mechanism for Avalonia

Mechanism is a collection of Controls, Themes, and other such tools, intended for use with [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/). More information will be added to this page as time goes on and development proceeds.

### Current state of development
At this early stage, I cannot promise that all of Mechanism for Avalonia is production-ready. That's not to say it necessarily isn't, more just that I don't know, and could use some help finding out.

### Currently-available Controls
- `ToolBarTray` and `ToolBar` (nearly feature-complete)
- `CommandBar` (feature-complete, in need of testing)
- `DecoratableWindow` (still under construction)
